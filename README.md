A toolbox for relative gene expression analysis and processing of raw protein datasets from the OrthoDB and EggNOG databases.
It retains NCBI_ID for each protein, standardizers FASTA sequence headers, and merges the cleaned datasets into a single 
FASTA file for subsequent analysis. In addition, it integrates gene expression data (RPKM values), performs normalization, 
and visualizes relative expression levels through heatmap generation.
